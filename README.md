# CropDoc
A web app for identifying diseases in plants by using computer vision and machine learning techniques on leaves.

# Description
This is a webapp developed using streamlit framework. Users can take an image of a leaf that is infected with a potential disease and the disease will be predicted using the trained models. Image classification models are trained with Tensorflow Keras and for faster inference they are convereted into onnx models.

Requirements
Opencv-Python
Streamlit
Pandas

To run the web app use the command 'streamlit run main.py'
